Get the lyrics for your favorite songs in a jiffy using the Lyrics Scraper. 
This program is built using **Python** and uses the **BeautifulSoup** and **requests** libraries to scrape the lyrics for a song from ***genius.com***. 

## Usage
Using the program is simple, you just have to clone the repo and then install the required libraries from the requirements.txt file using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once installed, run the script and input the Singer Name and the name of the song and get the lyrics!

## Issues
Since this among my first web scraping projects, it is still a bit rough around the edges. You might not get any response when searching for songs in languages other than English or when searching old songs. 
It is also possible that the lyrics for the song might not be available on **genius.com**. 

###### I hope to improve the project in the future once I have more knowledge about scraping.
